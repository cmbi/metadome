        <p>
          METADOM is developed at the Centre for Molecular and
          Biomolecular Informatics <a href="www.cmbi.umcn.nl">CMBI</a>
          and the department of <a
            href="https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research/departments/human-genetics"
            target="_blank">Human Genetics</a> at the <a
            href="https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/research" target="_blank">Radboud
            University Medical Centre</a> in Nijmegen.
        </p>

        <p>Our mission is to provide better insight into human
          genetic variation in the context of the protein. By using
          homologous domain relations to further enhance the amount of
          information even a single genetic variant may provide. And to
          provide further evidence for the functional impact of genetic
          variants. METADOM is aimed at professionals in the
          (bio-)medical field of human genetics who wish to visualize
          their mutation of interest in the context of normal genetic
          variation and provide detailed information of similar variants
          found across homologous domain positions. We hope that these
          new insights can be used directly in a publication and/or for
          intelligent design of further experiments.</p>

        <h1 class="title" style="color: #00AFDC;">Method</h1>

        <p>
          METADOM integrates publicly available data of human genetic
          variation to construct detailed information for a single
          protein and its protein domains. More information on this
          complex integration process can be found on the <a
            href="{{ url_for('web.method') }}">method page</a>.

        <p>We anticipate the publication of a method paper
          describing this web-service in late 2018. Until that is
          published, please use the following citation when referencing
          the results in your report:</p>
